    "\n",
    "- Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming is: Hiding the unnecessary details of how something works, and only showing the important features that the user needs.\n",
    "- Abstraction is about what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
    "- It’s different from encapsulation — encapsulation hides data inside an object, while abstraction hides internal logic behind a simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- EXAMPLE\n",
    "    - Driving a car:\n",
    "You turn the steering wheel and press the pedals — you don’t see how the engine, fuel system, or computer software is working inside. The car company has abstracted the complex internal systems and given you a simple interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Encapsulation in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "- wrapping data and funtions into a single unit (object)\n",
    "- Encapsulation is one of the four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — the others being Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "    - You hide the internal details of how something works.\n",
    "    - You only expose the necessary parts to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of it as data hiding + data protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔹 Why Encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Data security – Prevents unauthorized access to data.\n",
    "    - Data control – You can control how variables are updated (through methods like getters/setters).\n",
    "    - Flexibility & maintainability – Changes inside the class don’t affect outside code.\n",
    "    - Improved readability – Organizes code better by keeping related variables and functions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Imagine an ATM machine:\n",
    "    - You see buttons to withdraw, deposit, or check balance.\n",
    "    - But you don’t see how money is transferred between accounts internally.\n",
