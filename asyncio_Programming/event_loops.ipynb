    "### Async Event Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "- The event loop is the core of asynchronous programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is like a manager (or traffic controller) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Keeps track of coroutines / async tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Decides which task can run now.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Pauses tasks that are waiting (like await asyncio.sleep(2) or an API call).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Resumes them later when the result is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Without the event loop, coroutines wouldn’t know how to pause and resume — they’d just run like normal functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔑 How it Works (Steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "You create coroutines (async functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "You submit them to the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop runs them until they hit an await.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a task is waiting, the loop switches to another task.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the wait is over, the loop resumes the paused coroutine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Short\n",
    "\n",
    "Event loop is the scheduler in async programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "It runs, pauses, and resumes coroutines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes async code non-blocking and concurrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "note: In Python, the event loop is managed by the \"asyncio\" module."
