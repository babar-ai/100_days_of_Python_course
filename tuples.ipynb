    "# tuple\n",
    "A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. It is similar to a list but cannot be modified (i.e., you cannot change, add, or remove elements after creation). Tuples are defined using parentheses () and can hold multiple data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Features of Tuples\n",
    "- Immutable: Once created, elements cannot be changed.\n",
    "- Ordered: Elements maintain their position. there is only set which may not mantain order\n",
    "- Allows Duplicates: Tuples can contain duplicate values.\n",
    "- Supports Multiple Data Types: A tuple can store integers, floats, strings, lists, or even other tuples.\n",
    "-  cannot be modified after creation (i.e., you cannot add, remove, or change elements in a tuple).\n",
    "- Supports Indexing and Slicing â€“ You can access elements using an index, just like a list.\n",
    "- slicing in tuple is same to same as in list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Tuples\n",
    "- Faster than lists (due to immutability).\n",
    "- Memory-efficient.\n",
    "- Safe from accidental modifications"
